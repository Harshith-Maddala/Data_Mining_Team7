## 🚀 Project Overview

### What’s this about?  
We go beyond basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify **actionable insights** from Steam's vast gaming library. By leveraging statistical models and advanced techniques, we answer critical questions about player behavior, pricing trends, and genre popularity.

### What you’ll find here:
- **Player Engagement Metrics**: Which games and genres dominate the hearts (and hours) of players?  
- **Market Trends**: What drives pricing and ownership patterns in the gaming world?  
- **Game Characteristics**: How do factors like genre, release year, and multiplayer options shape success?

## 🧠 SMART Questions

Our project tackles the following **S.M.A.R.T. (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound)** questions:

1. **Price Patterns**:  
   What is the average price of games within each genre on Steam, and which genres have the highest and lowest average prices?

2. **Release Year Impact**:  
   How has the release year impacted the estimated number of owners for games, and are games released in the last five years more popular on average?

3. **Peak Engagement**:  
   Which games and categories (e.g., single-player, multiplayer) reach the highest peak concurrent users, and how do genre and game price affect this trend?

4. **Playtime Leaders**:  
   Which genres have the highest median playtime, and what trends reveal the types of games that keep players engaged the longest?
