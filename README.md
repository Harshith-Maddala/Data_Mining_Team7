# Beyond the Play Button: Insights and Trends from Steam’s Game Library 🎮📊

Steam is more than just a digital playground for gamers — it's a treasure trove of data waiting to be explored. In this project, we dive deep into the Steam ecosystem, analyzing playtime, pricing, genres, reviews, and player engagement metrics to uncover the secrets behind game popularity and success. Whether you're a player, developer, or data enthusiast, this repository is your roadmap to understanding the intricate dynamics of the gaming industry.

## 🚀 Project Overview

### What’s this about?  
We go beyond basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify **actionable insights** from Steam's vast gaming library. By leveraging statistical models and advanced techniques, we answer critical questions about player behavior, pricing trends, and genre popularity.

### What you’ll find here:
- **Player Engagement Metrics**: Which games and genres dominate the hearts (and hours) of players?  
- **Market Trends**: What drives pricing and ownership patterns in the gaming world?  
- **Game Characteristics**: How do factors like genre, release year, and multiplayer options shape success?

## 🧠 SMART Questions

Our project tackles the following **S.M.A.R.T. (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound)** questions:

1. **Price Patterns**:  
   What is the average price of games within each genre and across categories on Steam, and which specific genres or categories have the highest and lowest average prices? How do these pricing trends correlate 
   with game popularity as measured by Peak CCU?

2. **Release Year Impact**:  
   How has the release year affected the estimated number of owners for games on Steam, especially for those released within the last five years? Additionally, does the price of a game influence its number of 
   owners differently depending on the release year?

3. **Peak Engagement**:  
   Which games and game categories reach the highest peak concurrent users, and does this trend differ significantly across genres and game prices?

4. **Time Series Forecasting**:  
   How have game releases evolved over time across genres, and which genres have shown the highest growth particularly focusing on the top 10 genres from 2014 to 2024?
