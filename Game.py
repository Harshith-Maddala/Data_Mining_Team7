# High-Priced Genres and Categories:
#
# Genres like "Simulation" and "Audio Production" command the highest prices, likely due to their niche appeal and specialized features.
# Categories such as "SteamVR Collectibles" and "Remote Play on TV" align with premium experiences, targeting advanced gaming setups.
#
# Low-Priced Genres and Categories:
#
# Genres like "Free to Play" and "Massively Multiplayer" are among the lowest-priced, relying on wider audience appeal and alternative revenue models like in-app purchases.
# Categories such as "Mods" and "In-App Purchases" are also associated with lower-priced games, supporting broader accessibility.
#
# Granular Insights from the Heatmap:
#
# Genre-Category Intersections: Specific combinations like "Video Production" with VR categories show the highest average prices, indicating a premium segment for innovation-heavy experiences.
#
# Broad Trends: Most genre-category combinations have moderate to low prices, reflecting a market-wide emphasis on affordability.
#
# Market Strategy Takeaways:
#
# For Developers: Align pricing strategies with the niche or mass-market appeal of the genre or category.
# 
# For Consumers: Premium pricing correlates with advanced features, while affordability dominates in popular categories.


#%% [markdown]
# ### Step 6: Compare average prices across genres using ANOVA.
#
# ### Defining our null and alternate Hypothesis
#
# #### Null Hypothesis H0 : The average price of games is the same across all genres.
# #### Alternate Hypothesis H1 : The average price of games differs across at least one genre

#%%
from scipy.stats import f_oneway

# Group by genres

#%% [markdown]
# ##### The very small p-value (less than the standard threshold of 0.05) indicates strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis.
#
# ##### A higher F-statistic indicates a greater variance between groups compared to the variance within groups.
#
# ### There is strong statistical evidence that the average price of games is not the same across all genres. 
# ##### This means at least one genre has a significantly different average price compared to others.
#
# ##### To determine which genres differ, let us perform a post hoc test - Tukeyâ€™s HSD.

# %%

# %% [markdown]
# ### Key Findings:
#
# 1.	Significant Differences:
# Certain genre pairs exhibit statistically significant differences in their average prices (Reject=True), indicating that their price means differ beyond random variation.
# Example: Video Production vs. Violent: Mean Difference = -11.96.
# Interpretation: Violent games are significantly cheaper than Video Production games.
#
# 2.	Non-Significant Differences:
# Other genre pairs show no statistically significant difference (Reject=False), meaning the average prices between those genres are similar.
# Example: Video Production vs. Web Publishing: Mean Difference = -1.063.
# Interpretation: The average prices for these genres are not significantly different.

# %%

# %% [markdown]

# #### 1. Key Genres with Higher Prices (Red Clusters):
# 
# Genres like Web Publishing, Video Production, and Simulation often feature higher prices, as evidenced by the positive mean differences when compared to cheaper genres.
#
# #### 2. Key Genres with Lower Prices (Blue Clusters):
#
# Genres like Free To Play, Violent, and Casual consistently have lower average prices, as seen in their negative mean differences with higher-priced genres.
#
# #### 3. Widest Price Gaps:
#
# The largest price gaps occur between genres like Video Production and Violent or Web Publishing and Free To Play.
#
# Some genre pairs (lighter colors) show mean differences close to zero, indicating that their average prices are not significantly different (e.g., Simulation and Sports).

plt.show()

#%% [markdown]
# Chi-Square Statistic: 48145.96
#
# p-value: 0.00
#
# Since the p-value is less than the standard significance threshold of 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. This indicates a strong statistical association between game categories and price categories, meaning that the price of a game is significantly influenced by its category. 
#
# Interpretation from heatmap
#
# Category Distribution Across Price Tiers:
#
# The "Single-player" category stands out with a significant concentration in all three price categories, especially in the "Low" price tier, indicating its popularity and affordability.
# Categories like "Multi-player" and "Full controller support" also have notable counts across price categories, with slightly higher representation in the "Medium" and "High" price tiers.
#
# High-Price Categories:
#
# Niche categories such as "VR Only," "SteamVR Collectibles," and "Tracked Motion Controller Support" show higher counts in the "High" price category, likely reflecting the premium nature of these technologies.
# 
# Low-Price Categories:
#
# Common and accessible categories like "Steam Achievements" and "Stats" are heavily concentrated in the "Low" price tier, suggesting they are included in more budget-friendly games.
# 
# Balanced Categories:
#
# Categories like "Shared/Split Screen Co-op" and "Steam Cloud" show relatively balanced distributions across all price tiers, indicating their versatility and inclusion in games with varied pricing strategies.

#### Pricing Trends:
#
# Genres with niche appeal or low production costs (e.g., documentaries, free-to-play games) tend to be in the lower price clusters.
#
# Popular and immersive genres (e.g., RPG, Action, Strategy) justify higher prices due to higher development costs and a loyal audience.
#
#### Popularity (Peak CCU):
#
# Cluster 3 highlights that some tgenres, like "Photo Editing," can achieve extreme popularity despite moderate prices, indicating a unique value proposition.
#
# Cluster 2 confirms that mainstream genres (e.g., Adventure, Simulation) consistently attract large audiences.
#
# #### Business Strategy Recommendations:

# #### The KNN model's classification performance is outstanding, with near-perfect precision, recall, and F1-scores across all price categories (Low, Medium, High).
# Conclusion about the KNN Model:
# 
# Classification Report:
#
# The model achieves perfect precision, recall, and F1-scores (1.00) for all classes (Low, Medium, High).
# 
# the classes are balanced, and no single class dominates the dataset significantly.
#
# This indicates that the model is highly accurate in predicting all three price categories without any bias towards one class.
#
# The overall accuracy score is 99.9%, indicating perfect performance on the test data.
#
# Despite having high accuracy, the model is unlikely to over fit due to balanced classes and fewer misclassifications across different price groups
#
# Also, as KNN is a straightforward, non-parametric model that generally doesn't overfit unless the dataset is extremely small or noisy. This huge dataset should not be a concern.
#
# Hence, the low number of misclassifications suggests that the data may inherently have clear distinctions between classes, making KNN highly effective for this scenario.
#
# Model Evaluation:
#
# The KNN model has successfully utilized features like Genres, Price, and Peak CCU to classify price categories effectively.
#
# #### This model demonstrates that pricing and CCU, combined with genre data, are strong predictors of game success and cluster categorization.
