# ## 1. Importing Required Libraries

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import rfit 


#%% [markdown]
# ## 2. Loading the Dataset
games_df = pd.read_csv('games.csv', index_col=False)

# Display the first 5 rows of the dataset to get an overview of its structure and content
print(games_df.head())


# %% [markdown]
# ## 3. Basic Exploration of the Dataset

# Check the shape of the dataset (number of rows and columns)
games_df.shape

# Check the data types of each column to understand what kind of data we are working with
games_df.dtypes

# Check for missing values in each column; this helps us identify if any data cleaning is needed
print(games_df.isnull().sum())

# %% [markdown]
# ## 4. Descriptive Statistics for Numerical Columns

# Get summary statistics for numerical columns in the dataset (e.g., mean, min, max, etc.)
print(games_df.describe())


# %% [markdown]
# ## 5. Data Cleaning: Dropping Missing Values and Normalizing Genres
# Define the columns to remove from the dataset
removed_columns = ['AppID', 'Screenshots', 'Reviews', 'Header image', 'Website', 'Support url', 
                   'Support email', 'Metacritic url', 'Notes', 'Average playtime two weeks', 
                   'Median playtime two weeks', 'Median playtime forever', 'Movies',
                   'Score rank']

# Drop these columns from the dataset
games_df_cleaned = games_df.drop(columns=removed_columns).copy()

# # Print the "Genres" column to inspect its content before further processing.
print(games_df_cleaned["Tags"])

# # Convert all genre names to lowercase for consistency (this helps in grouping similar genres later).
games_df_cleaned["Tags"] = games_df_cleaned["Tags"].str.lower()

games_df_cleaned = games_df_cleaned.dropna(subset=['Categories'])
games_df_cleaned = games_df_cleaned.dropna(subset=['Genres'])
games_df_cleaned = games_df_cleaned.dropna(subset=['Tags'])

games_df_cleaned['Developers'].fillna('Unknown', inplace=True)
games_df_cleaned['Publishers'].fillna('Unknown', inplace=True)

# %% [markdown]
# ## 6. Final Check for Missing Values After Cleaning

# After cleaning, check if there are any remaining missing values in the cleaned dataset.
print(games_df_cleaned.isnull().sum())
games_df_cleaned.shape

games_df_cleaned.to_csv("games_df_cleaned.csv")

games_df_cleaned.head()
# %% [markdown] 

## Which games and game categories (e.g., single-player, multiplayer) consistently reach the highest peak concurrent users, and does this trend differ significantly across genres and game prices?
## Interchanging column names 
col_names = list(games_df_cleaned.columns)
print(col_names)
col_names[-1], col_names[-2] = col_names[-2], col_names[-1]
games_df_cleaned.columns = col_names

games_df_cleaned.head()
